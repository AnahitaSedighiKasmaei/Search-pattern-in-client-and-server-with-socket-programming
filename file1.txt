The term 'peace' originates most recently from the Anglo-French pes, and the Old French pais, meaning "peace,
 reconciliation, silence, agreement" (11th century).[4] The Anglo-French term pes itself comes from the Latin pax, meaning "peace,
  compact, agreement, treaty of peace, tranquility, absence of hostility, harmony." The English word came into use in 
  various personal greetings from c.1300 as a translation of the Hebrew word shalom, which, according to Jewish theology,
   comes from a Hebrew verb meaning 'to be complete, whole'.
